PiPurr-For-Firefox-OS
=====================

HTML5 version of PiPurr.

Mainly for installation onto Firefox OS, but works as a WebApp too.

This repo also contains a package.manifest and install.html to allow local installation onto a real Firefox OS device. The URLs in here are specific to my development environment and will need to be changed.
